AutoGenie is an AI‑powered predictive maintenance system that analyzes vehicle sensor data to predict potential failures and automatically trigger maintenance workflows.

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://autogenie.vercel.app/

---

## What It Does
- Predicts vehicle failure risk using machine learning  
- Automates maintenance decisions using agentic workflows  
- Triggers service scheduling, customer notifications, and feedback logging  

---

## How It Works
1. Vehicle sensor data is sent to an ML prediction API  
2. Risk level is evaluated (LOW / HIGH)  
3. High‑risk cases trigger automated agents for:
   - Predictive diagnostics  
   - Service scheduling  
   - Customer engagement  
   - Manufacturing feedback

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Vercel  
- **Backend & ML:** Python, FastAPI, Scikit‑learn  
- **Automation:** n8n (Agentic workflows, Cron/Webhooks)  
- **APIs:** REST APIs

## Why It Matters
Demonstrates real‑world application of **AI + automation**, showcasing system design, ML integration, and end‑to‑end workflow orchestration.
