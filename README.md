AI‑Driven Predictive Maintenance & Agentic Workflow Automation
Developed an end‑to‑end AI‑powered predictive maintenance system for the automotive domain using a multi‑agent architecture. The solution ingests real‑time vehicle sensor data, performs machine‑learning–based failure prediction, and autonomously triggers maintenance workflows. A central Master Agent orchestrates multiple specialized agents for predictive diagnostics, service scheduling, customer communication, and manufacturing feedback. The system demonstrates real‑time decision‑making, automated service booking, and closed‑loop insights for OEM quality improvement.
